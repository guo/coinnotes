# Best Practice of Storing ETH/ERC20 Tokens Offline

1. Create an encrypted disk on Mac with a complicated password. A sparse bundle is recommended to save you space. 
2. Download myetherwallet. An older version or known stable version is better than latest. The latest may have bugs or risk being hacked.
3. Store your myetherwallet copy in the encrypted disk.
4. Open Chrome (latest) and create a new profile without any extensions (or use incognito mode).
5. Open index.html of the local version myetherwallet.
6. Start creating wallet.
7. Make a backup of your private key / key store file and password. I highly recommend KeePassX to store your password or private key. You can store the encrypted db into the encrypted disk. 
8. Put your encrypted disk in to USD Drive. Make two copies of the drives in case one is broken. Storing on dropbox or google drive is OK as long as you have a strong password. 
9. When you use your private key, if you don't trust your computer environment, don't use copy and paste. Any app can access your clipboard. Clipboard is not designed for security. You can use drag and drop instead.
