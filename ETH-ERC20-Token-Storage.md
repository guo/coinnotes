# Best Practice of Storing ETH/ERC20 Tokens with MyEtherWallet

1. Create an encrypted disk on Mac with a complicated password. A sparse bundle is recommended to save you space. (https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22247) 
2. Download myetherwallet. An older version or known stable version is better than latest. The latest may have bugs or risk being hacked. A local version is fully working, thanks to the MEW author. It is better than the online version because there can be risk of the server being hacked. 
3. Store your myetherwallet copy in the encrypted disk to prevent it from being modified.
4. Open Google Chrome (latest) and open incognito mode (or other browser that supports clean version.)
5. Open index.html of the local version of myetherwallet.
6. Start creating wallet. Yay!
7. Make a backup of your private key / key store file and password. I highly recommend KeePassX to store your password or private key. You can store the encrypted KeePassX db into your encrypted disk. 
8. Put your encrypted disk in to a USD Drive. Make two copies of the drives in case one is broken. Storing on dropbox or google drive is OK as long as you have a strong password with OTP. 
9. When you use your private key, if you don't trust your computer environment, don't use copy and paste. Any app can access your clipboard. Clipboard is not designed for security. You can use drag and drop instead.

Enjoy your tokens!
